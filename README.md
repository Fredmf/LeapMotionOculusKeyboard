LeapMotionOculusKeyboard
========================

Educational Demonstrator, to research the use of the Leap Motion in Conjunction with the Oculus Rift to interact with virtual keyboard like interfaces.

just clone and compile with xcode

build for OSX 10.9.1 and xCode 5.0.2

Projectfile for Visual Studio 2010 is included, but not up to date, with a bit of small work it should run nicely on Windows. I will use cmake for my next Project.
