========================

stuff for university

(onetime project, Oculus DK1 and Leap Motion, no further development)

Educational Demonstrator, to research the use of the Leap Motion in Conjunction with the Oculus Rift to interact with virtual keyboard like interfaces.

just clone and compile with xcode or Visual 2010

build on OSX 10.9.1 with xCode 5.0.2 and Windows 8.1 with Visual Studio 2010

or try the precompiled

releaseWin32.7z
releaseMac.zip

the CamOVR Class still doesnt work right. As you turn your head the eye matrices transform in the wrong direction.

Projectfile for Visual Studio 2010 is included, but not up to date, with a bit of small work it should run nicely on Windows. I will use cmake for my next Project.
